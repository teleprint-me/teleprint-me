# Quantization for Large Language Models

Quantization reduces memory usage and computation by representing floating-point values with smaller, integer-based formats (such as 4-bit or 8-bit integers). Each quantization block has a scaling factor, $\delta$, that maps the floating-point range to the integer range for storage and processing efficiency.

### General Formula for Delta Calculation

For a signed **n-bit** quantization, $\delta$ is calculated as:

$$
\delta = \frac{\text{max} - \text{min}}{2^{n-1} - 1}
$$

where:

- **max** and **min** are the maximum and minimum values within the block.
- $2^{n-1} - 1$ represents the maximum positive value for a signed **n-bit** integer.

This formula ensures that $\delta$ scales floating-point values to fit within the signed integer range, preserving as much information as possible.

### q8 Quantization (8-bit)

For **q8**, values are quantized to fit within the signed 8-bit integer range of $[-128, 127]$.

#### 1. Delta Calculation

$$
\delta = \frac{\text{max} - \text{min}}{127}
$$

#### 2. Quantization

To quantize a floating-point value $v$ within the block:

$$
q = \text{round} \left(\frac{v - \text{min}}{\delta}\right)
$$

- $q$ is the quantized 8-bit integer value, stored in `elements` of the `block_q8_0` structure.

#### 3. Dequantization

To reconstruct an approximate value from $q$:

$$
v_{\text{reconstructed}} = q \cdot \delta + \text{min}
$$

### q4 Quantization (4-bit)

For **q4**, values are mapped to fit within the signed 4-bit integer range of $[-8, 7]$. Since true 4-bit storage is unavailable, we pack two 4-bit values into each byte.

#### 1. Delta Calculation

$$
\delta = \frac{\text{max} - \text{min}}{7}
$$

#### 2. Quantization

For each floating-point value $v$ in the block:

$$
q = \text{round} \left(\frac{v - \text{min}}{\delta}\right)
$$

- Each quantized 4-bit value is stored in the `nibbles` array, packing two values per `int8_t` element.

#### 3. Packing Two q4 Values in an `int8_t` Element

Each `int8_t` in `nibbles` holds two 4-bit quantized values (`quant0` and `quant1`):

```c
quantized_nibbles[j] = (quant0 & 0x0F) | (quant1 << 4);
```

- `quant0` occupies the lower nibble (bits 0-3).
- `quant1` is shifted into the upper nibble (bits 4-7).

#### 4. Dequantization

To approximate the original floating-point value from $q$:

$$
v_{\text{reconstructed}} = q \cdot \delta + \text{min}
$$

### Bit Extraction for q4 Packed Data

To retrieve each 4-bit value from the packed `int8_t`:

```c
// Extract lower nibble (quant0)
quant0 = quantized_nibbles[j] & 0x0F;

// Extract upper nibble (quant1)
quant1 = (quantized_nibbles[j] >> 4) & 0x0F;
```

## Quantization Strategy for Transformer Layers

Quantization provides both computational efficiency and memory savings, but it introduces a trade-off between fidelity and compression. This section outlines **layer-specific considerations** for Mistral model quantization, balancing precision needs and computational benefits.

### Quantitative and Qualitative Effects of Quantization

#### Quantitative Analysis

Quantization reduces precision by mapping higher-bit floating-point values to a smaller integer format, impacting **memory usage** and **computational load** while enabling efficient deployment. Key takeaways include:

- **q8 Quantization**: This approach supports high fidelity across a range of applications and model sizes, providing significant compression with minimal performance loss. **8-bit quantization** emerges as optimal for balancing quality and efficiency, suitable for attention mechanisms, MLPs, and inference-focused scenarios.
- **q4 Quantization**: While q4 quantization offers substantial memory savings, it introduces noticeable quality degradation, particularly in smaller models (e.g., 7B parameters and below). Larger models (e.g., Mixtral at 56B parameters) can sustain q4 with lower fidelity loss due to greater parameter redundancy, although minor degradations still occur.

#### Qualitative Analysis

Quantization influences model comprehension, which is inherently more subjective:

- **Critical Layers**: Embedding, output, and normalization layers benefit from higher precision, ensuring stability and quality representation in critical model operations.
- **Attention Mechanisms (e.g., SWA and GQA)**: Selective quantization at q8 within these mechanisms balances memory efficiency with fidelity, supporting long-range dependency modeling without disrupting coherence.
- **Model Size Considerations**: Larger models experience minor qualitative impacts from quantization, whereas smaller models tend to show more noticeable changes in output quality, especially with q4 quantization.

### Key Insights from Quantization Evaluations

- **Consistency Across Tasks**: 8-bit quantized models maintain near-identical performance to full-precision baselines, achieving over 99% accuracy recovery across benchmarks.
- **Structural and Semantic Similarity**: Metrics like ROUGE, BERTScore, and STS confirm that q8 quantization preserves core semantic meaning and structural coherence across output, while q4 can introduce slight variability.
- **Model-Size Dependence**: Larger models (e.g., 70B, 405B) exhibit resilience to quantization, maintaining high fidelity even under q4, while smaller models require q8 for optimal performance retention.

### Layer-Specific Quantization Recommendations

Based on the Mistral model architecture, the following layers are identified for specific quantization strategies:

#### 1. High Precision Layers (16-bit or 32-bit)

These layers require higher fidelity to maintain model comprehension and quality.

- **Embedding Layer** (`model.embed_tokens.weight`): Essential for initial token representation, best stored in f16 or f32.
- **Output Layer** (`lm_head.weight`): Critical for accurate final predictions; higher precision ensures quality output.
- **Normalization Layers** (`input_layernorm.weight`, `post_attention_layernorm.weight`): Stabilizes the model; retain in f16 or f32 for consistent normalization across layers.

#### 2. Mid Precision Layers (8-bit)

These layers can benefit from q8 quantization, striking a balance between computational efficiency and quality retention.

- **Attention Mechanism Layers** (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj`): Essential for SWA and GQA. Quantizing these with q8 maintains high performance while providing memory savings.
- **MLP Layers** (`gate_proj`, `up_proj`, `down_proj`): Dense MLP layers are typically large and benefit significantly from q8 quantization without major loss in fidelity.

#### 3. Low Precision Layers (4-bit)

The q4 format, while not ideal for most primary layers, can be considered for certain auxiliary components if further compression is necessary, though care is advised to avoid performance loss.

## Quantization Profiles

These quantization profiles aim to balance computational efficiency and memory savings with fidelity across different layer types in the Mistral model. By adapting precision levels for each layer type, these profiles optimize model performance while retaining comprehension in critical layers.

### Overview

Two main quantization profiles are provided:

- **Q8 Profile**: A mid-range profile using a mix of f32, f16, and q8 precision for a balance between quality and efficiency.
- **Q4 Profile**: A maximal compression profile with more aggressive quantization, using f32, q8, and q4 to achieve substantial memory savings with some expected quality trade-offs.

| **MLP Layers**         | f16 or q8              | q8                        | q4                         | Dense layers benefit from compression; q4 reduces memory with acceptable quality trade-offs. |
| **Auxiliary Layers**   | q4                    | q8                        | q4                         | Auxiliary components can be maximally compressed in q4, while q8 provides modest efficiency gains. |

### Profile Summaries

#### Q8 Profile (Mid-Range Fidelity)

The **Q8 Profile** uses:

- **f32 precision** for embedding, layer normalization, and output layers to retain full fidelity in these essential layers.
