### PyGPTPrompt
PyGPTPrompt is a CLI tool that manages context windows for AI models, facilitating user interaction and data ingestion for optimized long-term memory and task automation. While it was initially designed for the [OpenAI REST API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), it now supports a wider range of AI models.

> **Note:** This application requires an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) from the respective AI model provider.

#### Application
[GitHub](https://github.com/teleprint-me/py.gpt.prompt)

#### Toolkit
- Linux
- Shell
- Git
- Python

### Bootstrap Arch Linux
Experimental, minimalistic, and modular shell scripts to bootstrap [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org).

#### Application
[GitHub](https://github.com/teleprint-me/bootstrap-arch-linux)

#### Toolkit
- Linux
- Shell
- Git

### Snake
A simple [SPA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) designed to explore the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). 

> **Note:** This application is a modified fork of [CodingWith-Adam/snake](https://github.com/CodingWith-Adam/snake).

#### Application
