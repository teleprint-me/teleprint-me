### PyGPTPrompt
PyGPTPrompt is a CLI tool that manages context windows for AI models, facilitating user interaction and data ingestion for optimized long-term memory and task automation. While it was initially designed for the [OpenAI REST API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), it now supports a wider range of AI models.

> **Note:** This application requires an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) from the respective AI model provider.

#### Application
