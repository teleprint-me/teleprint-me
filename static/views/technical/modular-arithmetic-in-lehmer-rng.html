Arithmetic in Lehmer RNG</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Modular arithmetic is a fundamental concept in the design of the
Lehmer Random Number Generator (RNG) in our project. By applying a
modulus operation, we can bind the generated random numbers to a fixed
range and ensure sequence positions wrap around predictably when they
exceed their limits.</p>
<p>This document provides an in-depth exploration of modular arithmetic
as it is applied in the Lehmer RNG, covering essential concepts such as
signed and unsigned integer behavior, overflow, and underflow.</p>
<h2 id="building-intuition-with-division-and-modulus">Building Intuition
with Division and Modulus</h2>
<p>Modulus arithmetic can be challenging to grasp at first, especially
when dealing with negative numbers or boundary conditions in C. However,
by understanding the fundamental concept of division and the remainder,
we can develop a solid intuition for modulus arithmetic.</p>
<p>Let’s start by reviewing the <strong>division</strong> concept:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\text{quotient} =
\frac{\text{dividend}}{\text{divisor}}$$</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\text{quotient} =
\frac{\text{numerator}}{\text{denominator}}$$</span></p>
<p>Both are equivalent. The latter is nicer than the former because we
can use the initial letters <span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>
(quotient), <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> (numerator), and
<span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span> (denominator), respectively.
This allows us to mitigate any conflicts in variable names.</p>
<h3 id="division-with-remainder">Division with Remainder:</h3>
<p>Modular arithmetic is based on the concept of division with
remainder. When you divide an integer <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> by another integer <span
class="math inline"><em>d</em></span>, you can write the division
as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>n</em> = <em>d</em> × <em>q</em> + <em>r</em></span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is the numerator (the
number divided into)</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span> is the denominator (the
number divided by)</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> is the quotient (how
many times <span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span> divides into
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>),</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is the remainder (what’s
left over after <span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span> is
subtracted from <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> as many
times as possible).</li>
</ul>
<p>The modulus operation directly gives us the remainder <span
class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>. Mathematically, this is written
as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>n</em> mod  <em>d</em> = <em>r</em></span></p>
<p>This expression means we’re just focusing on the remainder when
dividing <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> by <span
class="math inline"><em>d</em></span>, ignoring the quotient. This
operation returns the remainder <span
class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> when <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is divided by <span
class="math inline"><em>d</em></span>, and <span
class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> always satisfies the condition
where <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is greater than or
equal to <span class="math inline">0</span> and is less than the
absolute value of <span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span>.</p>
<p>This can be written mathematically as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">0 ≤ <em>r</em> &lt; |<em>d</em>|</span></p>
<p>We can define this as for all <span
class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> within the set of integers such
that the absolute value of <span class="math inline">|<em>d</em>|</span>
is positive.</p>
<p>The more compact definition of this might look like the
following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">∀<em>r</em> ∈ ℤ</span></p>
<p>We can expand this expression by defining <span
class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> as a <em>specific subset</em> of
integers constrained by the modulus operation:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>r</em> ∈ {0, 1, 2, …, |<em>d</em>| − 1}</span></p>
<p>This emphasizes that <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is
not just any integer and that it remains within the bounds of the
modulus result.</p>
<p>This allows us to say that <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> mod  <em>d</em></span> is congruent with
<span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>n</em> mod  <em>d</em> ≡ <em>r</em></span></p>
<p>To say that this is congruent means we define the expression as being
two numbers which have the same remainder when divided by a third
number. For example, 10 and 3 are congruent when the modulus is 1.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Modular arithmetic can be a bit tricky, especially when dealing with
negative numbers or boundary conditions in C. To help build intuition,
let’s go over some examples to illustrate the concept.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-10-div-5">Example 1: <span
class="math inline">10 ÷ 5</span></h3>
<p><span class="math display">10 = 5 × 2 + 0</span></p>
<p>The remainder <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> = 0</span> because
10 is evenly divisible by 5. Therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math display">10 mod  5 = 0</span></p>
<h3 id="example-2-10-div-3">Example 2: <span
class="math inline">10 ÷ 3</span></h3>
<p>Here’s where it gets interesting:</p>
<p><span class="math display">10 = 3 × 3 + 1</span></p>
<p>The remainder <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> = 1</span> because
10 isn’t evenly divisible by 3; we can subtract 9 (<span
class="math inline">3 × 3</span>) from 10, and we’re left with 1.
So:</p>
<p><span class="math display">10 mod  3 = 1</span></p>
<p>The <strong>modulus</strong> operation effectively gives you the
leftover portion after you subtract as many multiples of the divisor as
possible.</p>
<h3 id="extension-to-modular-arithmetic">Extension to Modular
Arithmetic</h3>
<p>Modular arithmetic is fascinating because of how it “wraps” numbers.
If we “overflow” or “underflow”, we simply “wrap” around due to how the
remainder works out.</p>
<p>This wrapping behavior is a core property of modulus, and it’s why
modulus is so useful in applications like random number generation,
hashing, or circular buffers.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-negative-values-and-modulus">Example 3: Negative
Values and Modulus</h3>
<p>When working with <strong>negative numbers</strong> in modulus,
things can get confusing. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display"> − 1 mod  3 = 2</span></p>
<p>Why? Because:</p>
<p><span class="math display"> − 1 = 3 × (−1) + 2</span></p>
<p>In this case, the remainder has to be non-negative, so the modulus
operation gives us 2. Essentially, we’re “wrapping” around the range
defined by the divisor (3) and ensuring the result is positive.</p>
<h2 id="modulus-and-overflowunderflow">Modulus and
Overflow/Underflow</h2>
<p>In programming, modulus arithmetic is valuable because it constrains
values within a certain range. When performing an operation like:</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>a</em> mod  <em>m</em></span></p>
<p>the result is always between <span class="math inline">0</span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em> − 1</span>, no matter how large or
small <code>a</code> is. This makes modulus an ideal tool for handling
cyclic behavior, such as wrapping sequence positions in an RNG or
managing circular buffers.</p>
<h3 id="position-management">Position Management</h3>
<p>Consider traversing a sequence of values with an upper bound of 256
values. The lower boundary is 0 and the upper boundary is 256.</p>
<p>We keep track of where we are by defining a
<strong>position</strong>. If the position is
<strong>unbounded</strong>, then we may traverse undefined values. If
the position is <strong>bounded</strong>, then we may traverse defined
values.</p>
<p>By binding the position to the sequence boundaries, we remain within
a range of known values.</p>
<p>For example, when dealing with a position that can decrement below 0,
the modulus operation ensures that the position “wraps” back to the
upper bound.</p>
<p>When programming, we would begin by defining the position and
boundary:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>const unsigned int boundary = 256;
signed int position = 0;</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>position</code> starts at 0,</li>
<li><code>boundary</code> is 256 (the maximum value for an 8-bit
integer).</li>
</ul>
<pre class="c"><code>position = (position - 1) % boundary;</code></pre>
<p>If <code>position</code> is decremented below 0, the modulus
operation wraps it back into the valid range
<code>[0, boundary - 1]</code>.</p>
<h4 id="stepping-through-the-example">Stepping Through the Example:</h4>
<p>Let’s mathematically step through what happens:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Start with position = 0</strong><br />
Subtract 1:<br />
<span class="math display">position = 0 − 1 =  − 1</span><br />
Apply modulus:<br />
<span class="math display"> − 1 mod  256 = 255</span><br />
Result: <code>position</code> becomes 255, effectively wrapping around
to the other end of the range.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decrement again from 255</strong><br />
Subtract 1:<br />
<span class="math display">position = 255 − 1 = 254</span><br />
Apply modulus:<br />
<span class="math display">254 mod  256 = 254</span><br />
No wrapping is needed in this case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This process continues, ensuring that even as <code>position</code>
decrements beyond the lower boundary, it wraps around correctly due to
the modulus operation. This predictable behavior allows for safe
navigation within the sequence.</p>
<h3 id="modulus-as-a-bounding-mechanism">Modulus as a Bounding
Mechanism</h3>
<p>Thinking of modulus as a <strong>bounding mechanism</strong> helps to
better understand its usefulness in certain contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>It keeps values <strong>within a specified range</strong>,
regardless of the size of the input.</li>
<li>It’s ideal for managing <strong>cyclic structures</strong>, such as
wrapping around the ends of arrays, managing indices in circular
buffers, or ensuring random number outputs are within a defined
range.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modulus arithmetic may initially seem unintuitive because it deals
with wrapping values, which isn’t immediately obvious when considering
division. However, the key advantage of modulus lies in its ability to
<strong>constrain values</strong> within a specific range, making it an
essential tool for many algorithms and applications.</p>
<p>In the context of the Lehmer generator, the modulus ensures that the
seed or position <strong>remains within valid bounds</strong> (i.e.,
within the range of the sequence or array) even when incrementing or
decrementing beyond the limits.</p>
<p>Modular arithmetic isn’t just division with a twist—it’s also a
powerful tool for handling cyclic behavior, which is why it appears in
areas like number theory, cryptography, and computer science
algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="modulus-operation">Modulus Operation</h3>
<h4 id="signed-and-unsigned-integers">Signed and Unsigned Integers</h4>
<p>In C, the behavior of signed and unsigned integers differs when it
comes to overflow and underflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signed Integers:</strong> When a signed integer overflows,
it wraps around to the other end of its value range. This behavior is
predictable and can be thought of as a “safe” overflow.</li>
<li><strong>Unsigned Integers:</strong> Unsigned integers do not wrap
around on overflow. Instead, the value can overflow into adjacent memory
resulting in undefined behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overflow-and-underflow">Overflow and Underflow</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overflow:</strong> When a signed integer exceeds its maximum
value, it wraps around to the minimum possible value. In contrast, an
unsigned integer may produce unexpected results as it does not have a
negative range.</li>
<li><strong>Underflow:</strong> For signed integers, underflow behaves
similarly to overflow but in the opposite direction. The value wraps
around to the maximum possible value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practical-use-of-modulus-in-lehmer-rng">Practical Use of Modulus
in Lehmer RNG</h2>
<p>In the Lehmer RNG, we use modular arithmetic to handle sequence
generation and boundary enforcement. The modulus ensures that positions
in the sequence remain within valid bounds, and overflows or underflows
do not result in undefined behavior.</p>
<pre class="c"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define LIMIT 10

int main(void) {
    // signed int wraps around when overflows occur
    signed int position = 0; // this cannot overflow
    // unsigned int simply overflows and does not wrap around
    const unsigned int boundary = 256; // this can overflow

    // step backwards over each iteration
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; LIMIT; i++) {
        // negate the position and bind it to the boundary
        position = (position - 1) % boundary;
        // output the current position
        printf(&quot;position: %d\n&quot;, position);
    }

    // return on success
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<pre class="c"><code>signed int position = 0;
const unsigned int boundary = 256;

position = (position - 1) % boundary;</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>position</code> variable is decremented, and the
modulus operation ensures that it stays within the bounds defined by
<code>boundary</code>. If the position underflows, it wraps around to
the maximum boundary value.</p>
<h3 id="simplifying-expressions">Simplifying Expressions</h3>
<p>In certain cases, you may see the following pattern:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>position = (position - 1 + boundary) % boundary;</code></pre>
<p>This can be simplified to:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>position = (position - 1) % boundary;</code></pre>
<p>Both expressions are equivalent because the modulus operation ensures
the result stays within bounds, eliminating the need to explicitly add
the boundary in most cases.</p>
<h2 id="sign-behavior-of-modulus">Sign Behavior of Modulus</h2>
<p>In modular arithmetic, the sign of the divisor (denoted as
<code>m</code>) plays an important role in determining the sign of the
remainder when performing the modulus operation. Understanding how this
behavior works is crucial when using modular arithmetic in
programming.</p>
<h4 id="positive-divisor-m-0">1. <strong>Positive Divisor
(<code>m &gt; 0</code>)</strong></h4>
<p>When the divisor <code>m</code> is positive, the modulus operation
<code>a % m</code> always returns a remainder within the range
<code>[0, m - 1]</code>. This behavior holds regardless of whether
<code>a</code> (the number being divided) is positive or negative.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>a</code> is positive, the remainder is naturally between
<code>0</code> and <code>m - 1</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>a</code> is negative, the modulus “wraps” the result back
into the positive range.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a % m
2  # Remainder is within [0, 2]

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = -5
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a % m
1  # Despite being negative, the remainder wraps back to the positive range</code></pre>
<h4 id="negative-divisor-m-0">2. <strong>Negative Divisor
(<code>m &lt; 0</code>)</strong></h4>
<p>When the divisor <code>m</code> is negative, the remainder will
always fall within the range <code>[m, -1]</code>. This is because the
sign of <code>m</code> determines the wrapping behavior of the modulus
operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>a</code> is positive, the remainder is wrapped to be
negative.</li>
<li>If <code>a</code> is negative, the modulus operation still respects
the negative divisor and provides a remainder within the range
<code>[m, -1]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = -3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a % m
-1  # Result is within [-3, -1]

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = -5
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = -3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a % m
-2  # Result remains negative</code></pre>
<h4 id="ensuring-a-positive-remainder">3. <strong>Ensuring a Positive
Remainder</strong></h4>
<p>In some situations, you might want to ensure that the remainder is
always positive, even when <code>a</code> or <code>m</code> is negative.
To achieve this, you can adjust the modulus operation by using the
absolute value of <code>m</code>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = -5
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = -3
&gt;&gt;&gt; (a % abs(m)) 
1  # Using the absolute value of m ensures a positive remainder</code></pre>
<p>This technique is useful when working in contexts where positive
remainders are expected or necessary, such as when indexing arrays or
managing cyclic data structures.</p>
<p>Note that nesting the modulus to the result has no effect:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = -5
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; (a % m + m) % m
1  # Has no effect
&gt;&gt;&gt; (a % m + m) % m == a % m
True</code></pre>
<p>Adding the modulus to the result still results in no effect:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (a + m) % m == a % m
True</code></pre>
<p>We can see that they remain equivalent throughout. The expressions
retain their equivalency, regardless of structure.</p>
<h4 id="range-of-remainders">4. <strong>Range of
Remainders</strong></h4>
<p>In both cases, the remainder will always fall within the range:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>m &gt; 0</code>, the remainder is within
<code>[0, m - 1]</code>.</li>
<li>For <code>m &lt; 0</code>, the remainder is within
<code>[m, -1]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The modulus operation essentially binds values to these ranges,
making it a helpful tool for cyclic or wrapping operations.</p>
<p><strong>Examples with Larger Values:</strong></p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; m = 256
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 300
&gt;&gt;&gt; a % m
44  # Positive range [0, 255]

&gt;&gt;&gt; m = -256
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = -300
&gt;&gt;&gt; a % m
-44  # Negative range [-256, -1]</code></pre>
<p>In summary, the sign of the divisor determines the range in which the
remainder falls. A positive divisor results in a positive remainder,
while a negative divisor leads to a negative remainder. Using the
absolute value of the divisor can help ensure that the remainder is
always positive, which is useful in certain applications.</p>
<h2 id="the-lehmer-rng">The Lehmer RNG</h2>
<p>The Lehmer Random Number Generator (RNG) is a classic example of a
<strong>Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)</strong>, widely used to
produce pseudo-random sequences. It extends the basic principles of
modular arithmetic by introducing two additional key concepts:
<strong>scalar values</strong> and <strong>recursive
scaling</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="formal-definition">Formal Definition</h3>
<p>The Lehmer RNG is defined by the equation:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>z</em>) = (<em>a</em>×<em>z</em>) mod  <em>m</em></span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is a Mersenne prime (a
prime number of the form <span
class="math inline">2<sup><em>p</em></sup> − 1</span>),</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is a prime multiplier (a
number divisible only by <span class="math inline">1</span> and
itself),</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> is the initial value
(known as the <strong>seed</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scalar-values">Scalar Values</h3>
<p>In the Lehmer RNG, the <strong>scalar value</strong> is represented
by <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span>, which serves as the
seed. This seed initializes the process and is crucial in generating the
sequence. Once defined, the seed <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> is used as the input to the
modulus operation:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>z</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub> = (<em>a</em>×<em>z</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>) mod  <em>m</em></span></p>
<p>Here, <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> is the
next value in the sequence, derived by scaling the current seed <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> by the
multiplier <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>, followed by a
modulus with <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>. The seed value
evolves through the sequence, confined within the range <span
class="math inline">[0,<em>m</em>−1]</span>.</p>
<h3 id="recursive-scaling">Recursive Scaling</h3>
<p>One of the key innovations of the Lehmer RNG is <strong>recursive
scaling</strong>. This means that the output of each iteration is used
as the input for the next iteration. Specifically, the result from one
step (the new seed <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span>) is fed
back into the equation for the next iteration:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>z</em><sub><em>n</em> + 2</sub> = (<em>a</em>×<em>z</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub>) mod  <em>m</em></span></p>
<p>This recursive process creates a sequence of pseudo-random values
that depends entirely on the initial seed.</p>
<h3 id="modular-arithmetic-in-the-lehmer-rng">Modular Arithmetic in the
Lehmer RNG</h3>
<p>The Lehmer RNG relies on modular arithmetic to keep the generated
numbers within a specific range. The general modulus operation is
defined as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>n</em> mod  <em>d</em> = <em>r</em></span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is the input value,</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span> is the divisor,</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is the remainder.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Lehmer RNG context, the modulus operation takes the form:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">(<em>a</em>×<em>z</em>) mod  <em>m</em> = <em>z</em></span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> = <em>a</em> × <em>z</em></span> is the
product of the multiplier and the seed,</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>d</em> = <em>m</em></span> is the
modulus (a Mersenne prime),</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>r</em> = <em>z</em></span> is both the
input and output seed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="seed-selection-and-iteration">Seed Selection and Iteration</h3>
<p>The selection of the initial seed <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em><sub>0</sub></span> is crucial, as it
defines the starting point for the entire pseudo-random sequence. After
each iteration, the output seed <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> becomes
the new input for the next round of calculations, recursively generating
the sequence.</p>
<p>This iterative process means the remainder <span
class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>, which is <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em></span>, functions as both the output and
input in each step. The choice of <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> helps ensure that the sequence
retains reasonable statistical properties and achieves a long period
before repeating itself.</p>
<h4 id="periodicity-and-weak-properties">Periodicity and Weak
Properties</h4>
<p>However, it’s important to note that these statistical properties are
inherently weak due to the periodic nature of the generator.
<strong>Periodicity</strong> means that no matter how large the modulus
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is, the sequence will
eventually repeat itself. Although this repetition may not be
immediately apparent, it is inevitable and mathematically derivable.
This upper limit defines the sequence’s period, which can introduce
weaknesses when high-quality randomness or unpredictability is
required.</p>
<h3 id="function-definition">Function Definition</h3>
<p>The function <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>z</em>)</span>
can be defined as the relationship between the input seed and the output
seed:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>z</em>) = (<em>a</em>×<em>z</em>) mod  <em>m</em></span></p>
<p>This defines a mapping from one seed value to the next, creating a
deterministic number sequence - e.g. A pseudo-random number generated
sequence.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the use of modular arithmetic is a fundamental aspect
of the Lehmer Random Number Generator. By understanding the properties
of modular arithmetic, we can harness its power to create bounded and
predictable sequences. This is crucial for applications that require
cyclic behavior, such as random number generation, hashing, or circular
buffers.</p>
<p>By normalizing the generated numbers to the set of integers <span
class="math inline">ℤ</span>, we ensure that the results are always
integers and can be easily bound within a specific range. This
normalization makes it possible to work with cyclic structures like
arrays and circular buffers effectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, understanding the behavior of signed and unsigned
integers, as well as the sign of the divisor, helps us to create more
robust and efficient algorithms. With the knowledge gained in this
document, you are now well-equipped to apply modular arithmetic in a
variety of contexts and tackle real-world problems with confidence.</p>
<p>We hope this document has served as a valuable resource for you, and
we encourage you to continue exploring the fascinating world of modular
arithmetic and its applications. Happy coding!</p>
